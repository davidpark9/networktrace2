          Description: 
          Located at 1300 Jackson Street, the Jackson Street 
          Lofts stand as a historic testament to Dallas's 
          ever-evolving landscape. Constructed in 1909, 
          this building has witnessed a dynamic array of 
          occupants over the years. Initially erected for 
          E. Eppstein & Co., liquor distributors, the 
          property shifted ownership to Sigel's in the 
          late 1910s and later hosted the United States 
          Tire Co. in 1918. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s,
          it served as a hub for various tenants until Ely
          & Walker Wholesale Dry Goods, a prominent St. 
          Louis-based company, established their Dallas
          offices within its walls, where they thrived
          for nearly three decades. In 2000, developer
          George Babashoff undertook the transformation
          of the four-story structure into eight 
          elegant condos, ushering in a new era while
          preserving its rich history. The building
          also briefly embraced Lenny's Sub Shop
          in 2005, before all units found new owners
          by early that same year. Today, the
          Jackson Street Lofts embody the fusion 
          of historical charm and contemporary 
          living, embodying the spirit of Dallas's
          enduring urban evolution.">

          Address: Reno County, Kansas

          Description:
          Reno County, located in South Central Kansas, 
          has a history dating back to the U.S. purchase 
          from the French in 1803. Settlement began when 
          Kansas ceased being Indian territory in 1861, 
          with the county officially established in 1868 
          and achieving self-government in 1871. It was 
          named after Civil War General Jesse Lee Reno. 
          Hutchinson, the county seat, was founded by Clinton
          Carter Hutchinson with a unique alcohol ban. The 
          county's Amish and Mennonite communities have left 
          a lasting cultural imprint. Railroads, particularly
          the Santa Fe, Rock Island, and Frisco lines, played
          a vital role in the county's growth, connecting it 
          to the eastern U.S., shaping its towns, and facilitating
          transportation of people and goods.

          Address: 1815 West Pine Wichita, Kansas 67203

          Description:
   
          The North Fork of Ninnescah River has shaped a valley
          through the Tertiary Ogallala formation's sand and clay
          beds, which lie atop the Permian red beds in the 
          Ninnescah formation. Below these red beds are layers
          of shale, salt, and anhydrite from the Wellington 
          formation. The region has several thousand feet of marine
          sedimentary deposits, including up to 15 feet of slopewash
          on valley sides, 35-foot-thick gravelly sand alluvial 
          terraces, and floodplain deposits up to 40 feet thick.
          The right side of the valley has sand and clay beds 
          from the Ogallala formation, absent on the left side. 
          The reservoir basin's floor and sides are primarily 
          shale, about 100 feet thick, from the Permian Ninnescah
          and Wellington formations. Below lies several thousand
          feet of sedimentary layers, including shale, limestone,
          salt, and anhydrite. The Ninnescah shale formation has
          a regional southwest dip, sometimes modified by gentle 
          folds, with no known faulting but common jointing in 
          the shale beds, possibly due to structural flexing.
